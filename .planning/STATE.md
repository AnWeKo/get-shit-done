# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Fully automated project initialization from spec files — user provides specs, GSD produces complete planning structure ready for execution
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Spec Reading & Synthesis

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived — spec reading/synthesis first, then pipeline automation, brownfield/validation, multi-runtime polish
- [Research]: No new agents or npm dependencies needed — 2 new files (command + workflow), rest is reuse
- [Research]: Agent reads raw spec files as text (never use extractFrontmatter on user specs)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Spec synthesis prompt engineering is the novel challenge — no existing pattern to copy directly
- Token limit strategy for large spec folders needs decision during Phase 4 planning
